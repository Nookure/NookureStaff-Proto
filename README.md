# NookureStaff Protocol

## What is this?
This are the protocol files for the NookureStaff project. This files are used to communicate the server with the client browser using the WebSocket protocol and the [NeoSocket server](https://github.com/Angelillo15/neosocket).

## Why this repo?
This uses the protobuf syntax to define the messages that the server and the client will use, this repo is only used to have a git submodule in the main project and browser, so the server and the client can use the same files to generate the code.

## How does this matter to me?
Sincerely, it doesn't matter to you, unless you are a developer who wants to create its own implementation or extend the current one. If you are a user, you don't need to worry about this.
